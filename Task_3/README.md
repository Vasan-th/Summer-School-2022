## Task 3
## Deep Learning Challenge

A [dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip) consists of 12000 images split into two parts - 10000 train and 2000 validation samples. The images belong to 10 classes. You can download the dataset [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip).

The classes being

- Amphibia 
- Arachnida
- Fungi
- Mammalia
- Plantae
- Animalia
- Aves
- Insecta
- Mollusca
- Reptilia

The task is to train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict which class the object in each image belongs to. You may make use of the [sample code](https://colab.research.google.com/github/analytics-club-iitm/Summer-School-2022/blob/main/Task_3/notebook/Task%203%20Notebook.ipynb) provided to start with.

### Instructions

- You have to work individually.

- You are requested to implement and train your model from scratch and report the accuracy on the validation split of the dataset.

- If you are done with your predictions, you are requested to submit the Jupyter Notebook on [this form](https://forms.gle/Eexk5S1u7vLkJh2k9).
